# Change log for xSQLServer

## Unreleased

- Examples
  - xSQLServerDatabaseRole
    - 1-AddDatabaseRole.ps1
    - 2-RemoveDatabaseRole.ps1
  - xSQLServerRole, add examples:
    - 3-AddMembersToServerRole.ps1
    - 4-MembersToIncludeInServerRole.ps1
    - 5-MembersToExcludeInServerRole.ps1
- Changes to xSQLServerDatabaseRole
  - Fixed code style, added updated parameter descriptions to schema.mof and README.md.
- Changes to xSQLServer
  - Raised the CodeCov target to 70% which is the minimum and required target for HQRM resource.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - **BREAKING CHANGE: The resource has been reworked in it's entirely.** Below is what has changed.
    - The mandatory parameters now also include ServerRoleName.
    - The ServerRole parameter was before an array of server roles, now this parameter is renamed to ServerRoleName and can only be set to one server role.
      - ServerRoleName are no longer limited to built-in server roles. To add members to a built-in server role, set ServerRoleName to the name of the built-in server role.
      - The ServerRoleName will be created when Ensure is set to 'Present' (if it does not already exist), or removed if Ensure is set to 'Absent'.
    - Three new parameters are added; Members, MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude.
      - Members can be set to one or more logins, and those will _replace all_ the memberships in the server role.
      - MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be set to one or more logins that will add or remove memberships, respectively, in the server role. MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude _can not_ be used at the same time as parameter Members. But both MembersToInclude and MembersToExclude can be used together at the same time.

## 6.0.0.0

- Changes to xSQLServerConfiguration
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The parameter SQLInstanceName is now mandatory.
  - Resource can now be used to define the configuration of two or more different DB instances on the same server.
- Changes to xSQLServerRole
  - xSQLServerRole now correctly reports that the desired state is present when the login is already a member of the server roles.
- Added new resources
  - xSQLServerAlwaysOnAvailabilityGroup
- Changes to xSQLServerSetup
  - Properly checks for use of SQLSysAdminAccounts parameter in $PSBoundParameters. The test now also properly evaluates the setup argument for SQLSysAdminAccounts.
  - xSQLServerSetup should now function correctly for the InstallFailoverCluster action, and also supports cluster shared volumes. Note that the AddNode action is not currently working.
  - It now detects that feature Client Connectivity Tools (CONN) and Client Connectivity Backwards Compatibility Tools (BC) is installed.
  - Now it can correctly determine the right cluster when only parameter InstallSQLDataDir is assigned a path (issue #401).
  - Now the only mandatory path parameter is InstallSQLDataDir when installing Database Engine (issue #400).
  - It now can handle mandatory parameters, and are not using wildcards to find the variables containing paths (issue #394).
  - Changed so that instead of connection to localhost it is using $env:COMPUTERNAME as the host name to which it connects. And for cluster installation it uses the parameter FailoverClusterNetworkName as the host name to which it connects (issue #407).
  - When called with Action = 'PrepareFailoverCluster', the SQLSysAdminAccounts and FailoverClusterGroup parameters are no longer passed to the setup process (issues #410 and 411).
  - Solved the problem that InstanceDir and InstallSQLDataDir could not be set to just a qualifier, i.e 'E:' (issue #418). All paths (except SourcePath) can now be set to just the qualifier.
- Enables CodeCov.io code coverage reporting.
- Added badge for CodeCov.io to README.md.
